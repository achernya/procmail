-------------------------- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS -------------------------------

A ".forward" file (or equivalent) mechanism for forwarding mail, *grep or
equivalent.

The most important system calls that need to be supported (among others):
fork(),read(),write(),dup(),wait(),pipe(),getpwent()

For a more complete list of all library references see "includes.h"

------------------------------ DESCRIPTION -----------------------------------

The procmail mail processing program. (v2.02 1991/06/12)

Can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort your incoming mail
into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to one or more
mailing lists), preprocess your mail, or selectively forward certain incoming
mail automatically to someone.

For installation instructions see the INSTALL file.

----------------------

Although I can't guarantee that the procmail program will perform as
required, I must say that I made the utmost effort to make procmail as
robust as any program can be (every conceivable system error is caught *and*
handled).

procmail was designed to deliver the mail under the worst conditions
(file system full, out of swap space, process table full, file table full,
missing support files, unavailable executables; it all doesn't matter).
Should (in the unlikely event) procmail be unable to deliver your mail
somewhere, the mail will bounce back to the sender.

For a more extensive list of features see the FEATURES file.

However, as with any program, bugs can not be completely ruled out.
I tested the program extensively, and believe it should be relatively
bug free (no known bug at the time).  Should, however, anyone find any
bugs (highly unlikely :-), I would be pleased (well, sort of :-) to hear
about it.  Please send me the patches or bug report.
I'll look at them and will try to fix it in a future release.
(BTW, if you should find any spelling or grammar errors in these files,
it's not priority one, but if you were sending me mail anyway, don't hesitate
to point them out to me; I like correct English just as much as you do).

Please note that this program essentially is supposed to be static, that
means no extra features (honouring the *NIX spirit) are supposed to be
added (though any usefull suggestions will be appreciated and evaluated if
time permits).

P.S. I don't mind if you feed the program files through your favourite C
     beautifier first, so any patches need not necessarily be from the
     original sources; I apply these patches by hand anyway.
