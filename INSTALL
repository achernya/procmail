To install procmail, lockfile and formail: edit Makefile accordingly (if you
use MMDF at your site, edit config.h as well) and type 'make install'.

'make install' will:
      - execute autoconf (a shell script that repeatedly calls the C compiler
	to determine if certain features/symbols are supported), which will
	create a file named autoconf.h
      - compile the *.c files, create the three stripped binaries:
	procmail, lockfile and formail
      - copy these binaries to $(BINDIR)
      - copy the man pages to $(MANDIR)


Minimal requirements:

procmail must be installed.
lockfile needs only to be installed if you plan to read several mailboxes
	with one of the standard mailers that don't support lockfiles.
formail needs only to be installed if mail sometimes arrives in nonstandard
	mailbox format (or if you want to generate auto replies, split up
	mailboxes/digests etc., see the man page of formail for more info).


If things don't compile automagically, I suggest you take a look at:
autoconf, autoconf.h, config.h, includes.h

For autoconf to work as intended, your compiler should either be fully ANSI
compliant, or you should NOT turn off all warnings; enabling all warnings
shouldn't hurt.  In most cases the default options in the Makefile will do.

The sources are supposed to be fully ANSI and K&R compliant.

If you run procmail by hand and pipe in some sample mail, then make
sure that if you kill procmail, you use "kill pid" and NOT "kill -9 pid".
Should procmail seem to hang, check if the $LOCKFILE is still present.
If you kill procmail with "kill pid" it will clean up the $LOCKFILE
itself.

Suggested command line for a test run: "procmail -d LOGFILE=/dev/tty"
(now type in a mail message).

Every user that wants to use procmail should have a .forward and a
.procmailrc file in his HOME directory.	 For starters, you can look
at the supplied example files in "examples".
(BTW, be sure to make .forward *world* readable).

For more info about the program, see the man page.

-----------------------Frequently Asked Questions-----------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Why does the logfile have lines containing "file -i not found"?

	Your egrep doesn't understand the -i option (ignore case).  Either
	use a different grep (e.g. set GREP to /bin/grep), or be sure
	to specify the 'D' option on every recipe.

2. I installed procmail (i.e. typed 'make install'), but how am I supposed to
   use it?  When I type procmail on the command line it simply does nothing.

	You're not supposed to start procmail from the command line.
	Be sure to have a .forward and a .procmailrc file in your home
	directory (see the examples subdirectory or the man page).

3. When I compile everything the compiler complains about invalid or illegal
   pointer combinations, but it produces the executables anyway.
   Should I be concerned?

	Ignore these warnings, they simply indicate that either your compiler
	or your system include files are not ANSI/POSIX compliant.
	The compiler will produce correct code regardless of these warnings.

4. The compiler seems to issue warnings about "loop not entered at top",
   is that a problem?

	No, no problem at all, it just means I wrote the code :-)
	That's just about the only uncommon coding technique (not formatting
	style, that's another topic) I use (don't think I don't try to avoid
	those jumps in loops, it's just that sometimes they are the best way
	to code it).

5. The compiler complains about unmodifiable lvalues or assignments to const
   variable.  Now what?

	Well, if the compiler produces the executables anyway everything
	probably is all right.  If it doesn't, you might try inserting a
	"#define const" in the autoconf.h file by hand.  However in any case,
	your compiler is broken; I would recommend submitting this as a
	compiler bug to your vendor.
