1. Getting the lot to compile
   --------------------------

To install procmail, lockfile and formail: edit Makefile & config.h accordingly
and type 'make install'.
Intended configurable options in Makefile are: the install-destinations
Intended configurable options in config.h are: KERNEL_LOCKS and MMDF support,
 standard environment presettings, trusted user ids.

'make install' will:
      - execute autoconf (a shell script that repeatedly calls the C compiler
	to determine if certain features/symbols are supported), which will
	create a file named autoconf.h
      - compile the *.c files, create the three stripped binaries:
	procmail, lockfile and formail
      - copy these binaries to $(BINDIR)
      - copy the man pages to $(MAN1DIR) and $(MAN5DIR)

'make deinstall' will:
      - remove the just installed files in $(BINDIR)
      - remove the just installed files in $(MAN1DIR) and $(MAN5DIR)


Minimal requirements:

procmail must be installed.
lockfile needs only to be installed if you plan to read several mailboxes
	with one of the standard mailers that don't support lockfiles.
formail needs only to be installed if mail sometimes arrives in nonstandard
	mailbox format (or if you want to generate auto replies, split up
	mailboxes/digests etc., see the man page of formail for more info).
	Formail is not called by procmail unless *you* tell it to.

If things don't compile automagically, I suggest you take a look at:
autoconf, autoconf.h, config.h, includes.h

For autoconf to work as intended, your compiler should either be fully ANSI
compliant, or you should NOT turn off all warnings; enabling all warnings
shouldn't hurt.	 In most cases the default options in the Makefile will do.

The sources are supposed to be fully ANSI, K&R and POSIX compliant.

2. DEBUGGING AID
   -------------

Since procmail is intended to run completely independent of any terminals, it
doesn't use the stderr output to display error messages.  It is recommended,
especially during debugging, to specify a LOGFILE (see man page) in the
rcfile or on the command line.	Procmail will log all serious problems it
encounters.  Of course, instead of a regular file, one could also specify a
terminal as the default logfile.

Also, procmail can be persuaded to be a lot more verbose by preceding the
logfile name by a colon.
Therefore a suggested command line for your first trial run would be:
procmail LOGFILE=:/dev/tty
(now type in a pseudo mail-message)

If all else fails, you can try uncommenting the "#define console" entry
in the config.h file.  This will provide you with the most verbose procmail
you can make.  It is of course a good idea to comment out this line again
after your troubles have been solved.

If you run procmail by hand and pipe in some sample mail, then make
sure that if you kill procmail, you use "kill pid" and NOT "kill -9 pid".
Should procmail seem to hang, check if the $LOCKFILE is still present.
If you kill procmail with "kill pid" it will clean up the $LOCKFILE
itself.

3. Setting up the environment
   --------------------------

Every user that wants to use procmail should have a .forward and a
.procmailrc file in his HOME directory.	 For starters, you can look
at the supplied example files in "examples".
(BTW, be sure to make .forward *world* readable).
MMDF users should note that they need a .maildelivery file *instead* of the
.forward file (see the man page for more information).

				---

4. Extra options if you are a system administrator
   -----------------------------------------------

If you are a system administrator you can decide to install procmail
globally (i.e. as an equivalent substitute for the local-maildelivery-
capabilities of /bin/mail), this has the advantage that users do not need to
have a .forward file anymore that calls up procmail.  Simply having a
.procmailrc file in the $HOME directory will suffice.  Operation is transparent
in this case (i.e. if no .procmailrc file is present in the $HOME directory,
mail will be delivered as usual).

For direct examples on how to do this, look at the examples/advanced file.

*******************************************************************************
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: install procmail setuid root (and/or setgid maildeamon)
		    install lockfile setgid maildaemon (and/or setuid root)

To obtain specific instructions on the best installation, type "make recommend"
