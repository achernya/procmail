			# We don't use a global lockfile here now
			# Instead we use local lockfiles everywhere

# Notice the double : in the next recipe, this will cause a lockfile
# named "$MAILDIR/todd.lock" to be used if and only if this mail is going
# into the file "todd".

::				# Anything from thf
^From.*thf\@somewhere.someplace
todd				# will go to $MAILDIR/todd


# The next recipe will likewise use $MAILDIR/uunetbox.lock as a lock file.

::				# Anything from people at uunet
^From.*\@uunet
uunetbox			# will go to $MAILDIR/uunetbox


# And here the lockfile will be $MAILDIR/henries.lock of course.

:I:				# Anything from Henry or henry (ignore case)
^From.*henry
henries				# will go to $MAILDIR/henries


# But you can specify any lockfile you want, like "myfile".  The following
# recipe will use "$MAILDIR/myfile" as the lock file.

::myfile			# All 'questions' will go to
^Subject:.*questions
toread				# $MAILDIR/toread

# Anything that has not been delivered by now will go to $DEFAULT
# BUT, since we have not specified any global lock file because we
# were working with local lock files, and since we are sending the mail to
# $DEFAULT now, we need to specify a lockfile for that too.  We use
# a global lockfile for that  (it won't be created until procmail 
# has parsed (needed to parse) up till here.

LOCKFILE=$DEFAULT.lock
