Don't complain about the formatting of my C code.  I know it's unconventional,
but it's my standard format.  If you don't like it, feed it through your
favourite C beautifier.

Yes, I do have my reasons for formatting it this way:
1. consistent, functional indenting
2. I got used to it
3. the C compiler doesn't mind at all
4. I get more program text on my screen when editing, hence I don't have to
   scroll as often to see other parts of the program while working, (you won't
   believe this, I know) and therefore it helps to get a better overview of
   the program
5. I hate it when I have to scroll back the screen those 5 lines just to see
   the top of the loop (and then back down to look at the end again, etc.)

And, now don't start flaming me about "bad practice", I don't consider this
formatting method bad practice (it's properly indented).

I consider "bad practice" to be unportable or non-ANSI code, which my code is
certainly not.
