Don't complain about the formatting of my C code.  I know it's unconventional,
but it's my standard format.  If you don't like it, feed it through your
favourite C beautifier.

Yes, I do have my reasons for formatting it this way:
1. consistent, functional indenting
2. I got used to it
3. the C compiler doesn't mind at all
4. I get more program text on my screen when editing, hence I don't have to
   scroll as often to see other parts of the program while working, (you won't
   believe this, I know) and therefore it helps to get a better overview of
   the program
5. I hate it when I have to scroll back the screen those 5 lines just to see
   the top of the loop (and then back down to look at the end again, etc.)
6. This is not a multi-programmer project (if it were, I agree, every one
   should use a more conventional style), and therefore a good place to show
   the world some alternatives

And, now don't start flaming me about "bad practice", I don't consider this
formatting method bad practice.  The only way it distinguishes itself from
normal formatting methods is by the distribution of whitespace (and that is
not even so "bad" since it is properly indented).  This uncommon distribution
of whitespace does not make the source harder to read; it just seems that way,
because you advance less lines in the same time while reading and trying to
understand the code.  If the code were more conventionally formatted you
would probably advance through the code just as fast, except it would seem
to be faster because you scroll more often.

I consider "bad practice" to be unportable or non-ANSI code, which my code is
certainly not.
