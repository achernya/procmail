1990-12-07: v1.00
            First release (after 2 weeks of coding and testing)
1990-12-12: v1.01
            Added fsync to procmail.c
            Removed longjmp in lockfile.c out of the signal handler
                (not portable, so I'm told)
1991-02-04: v1.02
            Changes to procmail.c:
               Added physical-write-error check
               Altered egrep invocation (left out the -s flag, not supported
                  on all machines; this didn't change functionality though)
               Avoided the 'dirty' allocation of one more byte than needed by
                  rewriting the bogus_header_replace routine
               Made the finding bogus headers more robust
            Added sysV lines in Makefile
1991-02-13: v1.10
            Changes to procmail.c:
               Fixed slight error in parsing the recipe when 'h' and 'b' where
                  specified
               Started using the official exit codes
               Made sure that the procmail is not influenced by falsely
                  set environment variables like LOCKSLEEP
