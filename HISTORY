1991/07/04: v2.10
	    Fixed bugs (regression bugs introduced in v1.99):
	       Misleading error message when a ':c' recipe was used on a
		  simple mailbox
	       Inability to change numeric variables from their defaults
	    Fixed slight descrepancy between /bin/sh parsing and procmail while
	       assigning something in backquotes
	    Added two more recognised headers to formail for splitting digests
	    Added MMDF mailbox format support to procmail and formail
	    Added MH mailbox format support to procmail
	    Extended the FAQ section in INSTALL
	    Improved the 'void' test in autoconf
	    Added three new features to procmail: 'A'-recipe option, "LOG"
	       keyword, "TIMEOUT" keyword
	    Changes to the man pages:
	       Made them more portable!	 (yes, I was surprised myself :-)
	       Documented the new features
	       Reformulated some things more clearly
	    Changes to the example files:
	       A better example for splitting up digests
	       Extended the 'advanced' examples by an elaborate ':A' option
		  example
1991/07/12: v2.11
	    Enhanced MMDF support
	    Ignoring SIGPIPE now, how could I ever have left it out?
	       This should take care of any, previously inexplicable,
		  mysterious failures of formail or procmail
	    Blanks are really ignored now on action lines
1991/10/02: v2.20 (never released)
	    Included an extensive guide on how to set up mailinglists
	    Split off the FAQ into a separate file and extended it
	    Replaced some 'forgotten' fork()s with sfork()
	    Changes to formail.c:
	       Added simple header-munging support to formail
	       Extended the number of recognised headers when searching for
		  the originating address by two
	       Made it concatenate continued header lines (in order to ensure
		  reliable header-munging)
	    Changes to procmail:
	       Added the DELIVERED keyword
	       Added some command line options, options are now not exclusive
		  anymore
	       Gave new meaning to the -d option, old meaning is transferred
		  to the LOGFILE assignment
	       It can now return EX_TEMPFAIL if needed
	       It can be used as a direct replacement for /bin/mail when
		  delivering mail
	       It can be run suid root (for enhanced functionality, this
		  is *not* intended to open up security holes, and as far as
		  I can see it doesn't)
	       Added a Usage message
	       Reorganised flags parsing, blanks can now be inserted anywhere
	       Added the 'i' flag
	       Dropped support for the 's' and 'I' flags
	       Enhanced the locallockfile determination code
	       Reordered some assignments in the signal-detect code, should
		  improve reliability
	       Dropped the SIGQUIT child-parent communication, has become
		  obsolete
	       Threw out sscanf, provided a strtol substitute
	       Made HARDLOCKS optional
	    Changes to exopen.c:
	       Yet improved the lockfile acquiring, more elegant and even more
		  fault tolerant than ever before :-)
	    lockfile and formail state their names on error messages now
	    Alphabetised the DIAGNOSTICS section of man/procmail.1
	    Added a 'deinstall' entry in Makefile
	    Improved Makefile installation feedback
	    Added a patchlevel.h file
1991/10/18: v2.30
	    Implemented a custom regular expression library (fully egrep
	       compatible), should eliminate the annoyances with incompatible
	       egreps
	    Changed the formatting (indenting) style in all the source files
	       (which blows up all diffs beyond proportion of course)
	    Accomplished the doubtfull milestone of having a source file
	       (regexp.c) which provokes a compiler error on an old compiler
	       (if using the optimiser)
	    Threw out the GREP environment variable
	    Ignoring leading spaces on condition lines now
	    Rewrote some parts to use the regexp lib, making the code smaller
1991/10/22: v2.31
	    Updated the example rcfiles
	    Added answers to FAQ list
	    Fixed portability problem with missing strpbrk and strchr
	    Cleaned up the lockfile creation when in explicit delivery mode
