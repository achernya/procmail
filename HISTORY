1990-12-07: v1.00
	    First release (after 2 weeks of coding and testing)
1990-12-12: v1.01
	    Added fsync to procmail.c
	    Removed longjmp in lockfile.c out of the signal handler
		(not portable, so I'm told)
1991-02-04: v1.02
	    Changes to procmail.c:
	       Added physical-write-error check
	       Altered egrep invocation (left out the -s flag, not supported
		  on all machines; this didn't change functionality though)
	       Avoided the 'dirty' allocation of one more byte than needed by
		  rewriting the bogus_header_replace routine
	       Made the finding bogus headers more robust
	    Added sysV lines in Makefile
1991-02-13: v1.10
	    Changes to procmail.c:
	       Fixed slight error in parsing the recipe when 'h' and 'b' where
		  specified
	       Started using the official exit codes
	       Made sure that the procmail is not influenced by falsely
		  set environment variables like LOCKSLEEP
1991-02-21: v1.20
	    Changes to procmail.c:
	       Removed library conflict on some machines for 'locking'
	       Added uname call as alternative for gethostname
	       Changed name of SHELLMETA to SHELLMETAS (for conformance
		  with dmake)
	       Added LOCKTIMEOUT to learn procmail to decide wether or not
		  a certain lockfile is still 'valid'
	       Added the function sputenv (smart-putenv) to avoid library
		  problems and to finally have a putenv that works the
		  way it was supposed to work all along (you wouldn't believe
		  how brain damaged this library function is :-)
	       Changed environment variable assignment to skip trailing blanks
		  only, and allow intermediate blanks (parsing like make)
1991-02-22: v1.21
	    Split up procmail.c in procmail.c, nonint.c, retint.c, procmail.h,
	       config.h, sysexits.h, shell.h
	    Changes to lockfile.c:
	       Added -l option (locktimeout)
	    Moved virtually all configuration stuff from Makefile into
	       config.h
	    Added -v option to procmail
1991-03-01: v1.30
	    Added out of memory/swap space immunity  (NOMEMRETRY)
	    Made forced terminations of procmail more reliable and verbose
	       (previously, procmail would display erroneous error messages
	       if an attempt was made to kill procmail more than once in
	       rapid succession)
	    Fixed up man pages and comments
	    Included more example files
	    Made sure that variable substitution works in locallockfile-
	       specifications too
