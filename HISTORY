1990/12/07: v1.00
	    First release (after 2 weeks of coding and testing)
1990/12/12: v1.01
	    Added fsync to procmail.c
	    Removed longjmp in lockfile.c out of the signal handler
		(not portable, so I'm told)
1991/02/04: v1.02
	    Changes to procmail.c:
	       Added physical-write-error check
	       Altered egrep invocation (left out the -s flag, not supported
		  on all machines; this didn't change functionality though)
	       Avoided the 'dirty' allocation of one more byte than needed by
		  rewriting the bogus_header_replace routine
	       Made the search for bogus headers more robust
	    Added sysV lines in Makefile
1991/02/13: v1.10
	    Changes to procmail.c:
	       Fixed slight error in parsing the recipe when 'h' and 'b' where
		  specified
	       Started using the official exit codes
	       Made sure that the procmail is not influenced by falsely
		  set environment variables like LOCKSLEEP
1991/02/21: v1.20
	    Changes to procmail.c:
	       Removed library conflict on some machines for 'locking'
	       Added uname call as alternative for gethostname
	       Changed name of SHELLMETA to SHELLMETAS (for conformance
		  with dmake)
	       Added LOCKTIMEOUT to learn procmail to decide wether or not
		  a certain lockfile is still 'valid'
	       Added the function sputenv (smart-putenv) to avoid library
		  problems and to finally have a putenv that works the
		  way it was supposed to work all along (you wouldn't believe
		  how brain damaged this library function is :-)
	       Changed environment variable assignment to skip trailing blanks
		  only, and allow intermediate blanks (parsing like make)
1991/02/22: v1.21
	    Split up procmail.c in procmail.c, nonint.c, retint.c, procmail.h,
	       config.h, sysexits.h, shell.h
	    Changes to lockfile.c:
	       Added -l option (locktimeout)
	    Moved virtually all configuration stuff from Makefile into
	       config.h
	    Added -v option to procmail
1991/03/01: v1.30
	    Added out of memory/swap space immunity  (NOMEMRETRY)
	    Made forced terminations of procmail more reliable and verbose
	       (previously, procmail would display erroneous error messages
	       if an attempt was made to kill procmail more than once in
	       rapid succession)
	    Fixed up man pages and comments
	    Included more example files
	    Made sure that variable substitution works in locallockfile-
	       specifications too
1991/03/15: v1.35
	    Fixed the problem when no rcfile was found (rc!=NULL)
	    Made my memmove replacement ANSI compatible
	    Fixed up the Makefile (include file dependencies were incorrect)
	    Started using RCS to manage the source
1991/06/04: v1.99
	    Changed NOMEMRETRY into NORESRETRY, now all machine limitations
	       are caught
	    Beefed up the parsing routine, now supports virtually complete
	       /bin/sh syntax (*all* quotes and escapes are understood)
	    Cleaned up the code, arranged for all remotely configuration-
	       dependent looking values to be in config.h
	    Created an include directory to catch missing include files
	    Created an autoconf script that determines all installation
	       specifics (all the user has to do now is make)
	    Threw out (the last?) BSD specific library routines
	    ANSI'fied the code, it's now as close as you can get to 'native'
	       ANSI while maintaining compatibility with K&R
	    Stopped using the %i identifier from sscanf
	    Improved the diagnostic messages when procmail is killed (tells
	       you what it was waiting for)
	    Made the file locking mechanism RELIABLE over NFS
	    Procmail now is able to deliver to directories too (AMS --
	       Andrew Mail System), it creates a uniquely named new file for
	       every new mail
	    Threw out the 's' and 'I' options in rcfiles, introduced 'D'
	    Completely rewrote the filter code, made sure that the pid number
	       off procmail does not change anymore while filtering
	    Threw out the stdio library (out of procmail) to avoid the hidden
	       malloc on fopen (I want to catch all mallocs), reliability
	       was improved, binary size did not shrink because the getpwent
	       library links in the stdio library (aargh!)
	    Procmail ditches the environment completely now upon startup
	    Provided a -p flag to preserve the environment
	    Provided a -d flag for debugging purposes (debugging rc scripts)
	    Improved logfile format, now logs a third entry on mail arrival:
	       which folder the mail finally went to and how long it was
	    Made logfile output line buffered to get a cleaner logfile if
	       several programs write it concurrently
	    Changes to lockfile.c:
	       Added -s flag to maintain step with procmail
	    Created formail.c:
	       A new (the third) program
	    Rearranged the routines a bit, so that two object files could be
	       shared between the three programs
1991/06/10: v2.00
	    Changed all "ambiguous assignments" to have a space inserted
	       (preserves compatibility with older compilers)
	    Made some more entries in the config.h file
	    Changes to formail.c:
	       Added strstr library replacement
	       Added the option to split digests
	    Updated the manual files (I hate doing this)
	    Updated the example files
1991/06/11: v2.01
	    Fixed up includes.h and autoconf to be more POSIX compliant
	    Fixed up small bug in readparse() (goodies.c) that caused trouble
	       with recursively nested backquotes (nobody will probably ever
	       use this, but I was testing worst case behaviour)
	    Documented the $$ environment variable in procmail.1
1991/06/12: v2.02
	    Fixed typo in strstr replacement
	    Fixed runaway line while logging long folder names
1991/06/20: v2.03
	    Added EX_OSFILE to include/sysexits.h (oversight)
	    Slightly changed the terminate code in procmail (more reliable
	       when forks did not succeed while filtering and signals arrived
	       during a small window)
	    Added a listing of all entries that can appear in autoconf.h
	       to autoconf to simplify manual autoconf.h generation
	    Changed formail to be able to split up collected articles (trivial)
	    Edited include/string.h, strspn is of type int
	    Changes to autoconf:
	       Added strtol detection
	       Enhanced const detection for braindamaged compilers
	       Stopped using the function grepfor, changed it into a small
		  script (Vltrix does not support functions in /bin/sh)
	       Made the check for missing library parts more resistant against
		  elaborate warnings from the C-compiler
	    Fixed typo in retint.c (sleep with one redundant argument), hurray
	       for prototypes
	    Added MANSUFFIX macro to Makefile
	    Avoided namespace conflict ("failurel") in lockfile.c for
	       braindamaged compilers
	    Renamed ultostr to avoided library conflict on some machines
