1991/10/18: v2.30
	    Implemented a custom regular expression library (fully egrep
	       compatible), should eliminate the annoyances with incompatible
	       egreps
	    Changed the formatting (indenting) style in all the source files
	       (which blows up all diffs beyond proportion of course)
	    Accomplished the doubtful milestone of having a source file
	       (regexp.c) which provokes a compiler error on an old compiler
	       (if using the optimiser)
	    Threw out the GREP environment variable
	    Ignoring leading spaces on condition lines now (means that
	       everything can be indented in the rcfile)
	    Rewrote some parts to use the regexp lib, making the code smaller
1991/10/22: v2.31
	    Added answers to FAQ list
	    Fixed portability problem with missing strpbrk and strchr
	    Cleaned up the lockfile creation when in explicit delivery mode
1991/12/05: v2.40
	    Cleaned the example rcfiles
	    Updated the FAQ list
	    Updated the man pages to fully correspond to the program again
	       (beautified them in the process)
	    Made a clear debugging-aid entry in the INSTALL file
	    Added the -a option to formail
	    Added an IFS environment variable override in procmail
	    Fixed regression bug in formail, it did not terminate if the mail
	       which was piped in did not contain an end of header mark
	    Made the -aiI options of formail work while splitting as well
	    Fixed bug in the new regexp lib (caused core dumps if the mail had
	       a null body)
	    Made procmail capable of healing the recipient's mail spool file
	    Corrected all the docs (fixed a spelling error)
	    Tricked NFS into supplying an access_time<modification_time for the
	       folders written
	    Added the 'a' flag to procmail
1991/12/13: v2.50
	    Fixed portability problems onto ISC in the autoconf script
	    Fixed bug in procmail evaluating $- and $$
	    Added -x option to formail
	    Made formail operate as orthogonal as possible with combinated
	       options
1992/01/22: v2.60
	    Complete overhaul of the regexp lib (reduced size, and fixed some
	       portability problems to buggy compilers)
	    Fixed lockfile not to modify argv[]
	    Removed superfluous escapes in the example files
	    Extended the portability of the autoconf script
	    Enhanced the response to signals (SIGTERM and SIGQUIT now have
	       different meanings)
	    Improved autoconfiguration for 16-bit machines
	    Updated the man pages/FAQ-list/INSTALL-file for MMDF support
1991/01/31: v2.61
	    Updated the directions for .forward file contents
	    Fixed the EDQUOT define (some machines didn't define it)
	    Eliminated a rare (no report of it occuring yet) inconvenience,
	       a temporary file could be left lying around if procmail would
	       be killed in a very small window after an open()
	    Kludge the username into lowercase after the -d option
	    Added specific directions for sites running smail (see
	       examples/advanced)
	    Added a search for sendmail in autoconf
	    Fixed a problem in the implicit-lockfile-searching code
	    Added the ARCHITECTURE variable to the makefile (for convenience)
