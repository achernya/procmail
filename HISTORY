	    Started using RCS to manage the source

1991/10/02: v2.20 (never released)
1991/10/18: v2.30
	    Implemented a custom regular expression library (fully egrep
	       compatible), should eliminate the annoyances with incompatible
	       egreps
	    Accomplished the doubtful milestone of having a source file
	       (regexp.c) which provokes a compiler error on an old compiler
	       (if using the optimiser)
	    Ignoring leading spaces on condition lines now (means that
	       everything can be indented in the rcfile)
1991/10/22: v2.31
1991/12/05: v2.40
	    Made a clear debugging-aid entry in the INSTALL file
	    Made procmail capable of healing the recipient's mail spool file
	    Tricked NFS into supplying an access_time<modification_time for the
	       folders written
1991/12/13: v2.50
1992/01/22: v2.60
	    Enhanced the response to signals (SIGTERM and SIGQUIT now have
	       different meanings)
1992/01/31: v2.61
	    Updated the directions for .forward file contents
	    Fixed the EDQUOT define (some machines didn't define it)
	    Eliminated a rare (no report of it occuring yet) inconvenience,
	       a temporary file could be left lying around if procmail would
	       be killed in a very small window after an open()
	    Kludge the username into lowercase after the -d option
	    Added specific directions for sites running smail (see
	       examples/advanced)
	    Added a search for sendmail in autoconf
	    Fixed a problem in the implicit-lockfile-searching code
	    Added the ARCHITECTURE variable to the Makefile (for convenience)
1992/04/30: v2.70
	    Added NO_USER_TO_LOWERCASE_HACK and NO_NFS_ATIME_HACK defines to
	       config.h
	    Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH protection (would have been a security hole
	       on some machines)
	    Fixed mistakenly default usage of KERNEL_LOCKS (was enabled
	       regardless of the definition of KERNEL_LOCKS in config.h), if
	       your system is running buggy lockd's, problems could have
	       occurred
	    Inserted some casts to shut up systems with ANSI compilers and
	       prototyped include files
	    Made sure logfile is flushed before forking
	    Made sure no library calls are made in signal handlers
	    Added a `vacation'-autoreply sample in examples/advanced
	    Worked around a `PATH' bug in some Bourne shells
	    Sped up sputenv, the smart environment handler routine
	    Made sure procmail checks the return value from close()
	    Made the man pages yet more portable (.LP->.PP)
	    Made it possible for lockfile to be setuid or setgid, so that
	       it is able to create and unlink lockfiles in the mail
	       spool directory, even if normal users cannot
	    Created the targets 'recommend' and 'suid' in Makefile, in
	       order to make suid/sgid recommendations even more obvious,
	       not easily overlooked and automatic
	    Worked around bugs in some compilers not accepting:
	       - struct eps const*const something;
	       - char a[2]; &a;
	    Worked around a bug in the SINIX include files (wrong protype for
	       uname)
	    Made procmail & lockfile clock skew independent (during LOCKTIMEOUT)
	    By popular demand: added possibility to select mails on size
	    Made procmail accept multiple recipients (this was not as trivial
	       as it sounds!), in order for complete compatibility with mailers
	       like smail 2.x
	    Expanded the mail-delivery-agent instructions in examples/advanced,
	       this includes specific intstructions for smail 2.x
	    Made special entries in config.h for semi-permanent environment-
	       variable overrides
	    Made formail more intelligent, it can now parse full-fledged
	       RFC822 addresses (quoting et al)
	    Let formail look at the Date: field when reconstructing the date
	    Changed stdin handling in forks in formail, to circumvent a bug in
	       HP/UX
	    A complete rewrite of formail, the code got bigger, the runtime
	       requirement got bigger, it got slower, but, it's more structured
	       (so much for structured programming :-)
	    Provide a separate strpbrk.c file, since I use it in several
	       programs now
	    Made procmail check the permissions of its invoker, generate
	       an overriding From_ line if necessary, and consequently made it
	       accept the -f option (fromwhom), and also the alternate obsolete
	       -r option of course
	    Wiped out the ./include tree, made autoconf check it instead (the
	       compile line looks so terribly clean now :-)
	    Procmail makes an additional security check on the rcfiles before
	       accepting them (owner and permissions, see man page)
	    Fixed the `spurious' 0660 permissions on system-mailboxes
